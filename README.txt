1) The Desicions Support System is completely written in Python (3+). So it is required PyCharm to open and run the DSS.

2) Open the project in Pycharm and run the file GUI.py . 

3) The GUI.py file calls inside functions, the pre-trained convolutional neural network through the file 'finalized_model.sav'.

4) The Decision Support System runs also in the Virtual Machine. This is provided to us in the assignment as requirement.

5) For the Virtual Machine, PyCharm needs to be installed and some important packages have to be downloaded so the DSS runs without bugs.

6) Important packages needed are the following : Numpy, tkinter, matplotlib, opencv, pickle, PIL, tensorflow (keras), sklearn, itertools. 

7) An image is attached to the zip file with the DSS running in the Virtual Machine.

8) This zip file (project) also includes two txt files where you can find the results after running the DSS. Crucial is to mention that into these txt files the names are APPENDED, so if the user wants to re-run the whole process with new images it's better to clear these files.
