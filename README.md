Detecting-healthy-plants-CNN-and-GUI-framework-with-Tkinter
In this project, we have used machine learning and computer vision to build an image classifier which will help us classify the images with bacterial spots. Our goal is to build a Decision Support System for users in the field of agriculture. By creating deep learning models we will help people differentiate between the healthy leaves and the leaves containing bacterial spots on them.
